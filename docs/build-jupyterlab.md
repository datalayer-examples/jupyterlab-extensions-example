# Build

By default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:

```bash
jupyter lab build --minimize=False
```

Use the following commands to completely rebuild JupyterLab and link the extension Javascript.

```bash
# Generate sourcemaps.
jupyter labextension build --development=True .
jupyter lab build --minimize=False
```

```bash
# Do not generate sourcemaps.
jupyter labextension build .
jupyter lab build
```
