# Lumino Application

To get a sense on how you can use the Lumino injection system, have a look at the `lumino-inject.spec.ts` in the `test`folder. You can try it with the following command.

```bash
jlpm run test:lumino-inject # TODO Fix the lumino-inject test.
```

TODO Create a Lumino application to showcase a simple dependency injection.
