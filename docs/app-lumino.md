# Lumino Application

To get a sense on how you can use the Luminon injection system, have a look at the `lumino-inject.spect.ts` in the `test`folder. You can try it with the following command.

```bash
yarn test:lumino-inject # TODO Fix the lumino-inject test.
```

- TODO Create a Lumino application to showcase a simple dependency injection.
