# JupyterLab Custom Application

You can create a custom JupyterLab application based on a set of chosen extensions. The [examples folder](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/examples) of the main JupyterLab repository showcases how to use the JupyterLab packages.

We have created in this repository a custom JupyterLab application. Have a look at the `jupyterlab.js` file in the `src` folder and run the following to try it out.

```bash
yarn build:app
yarn start:app
```

Such custom `Application`can be found in Notebook 7 and JupyerLite.
